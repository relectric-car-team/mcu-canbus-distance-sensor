  @Summary
    Handles ECHO IOC events

  @Description
    This function handles IOC interrupts when the ECHO pin changes to high or low. Furthermore,

  @Preconditions
    Initialize the TMR0 before calling this function and that sendTrigger has
    been invoked.

  @Description
    This function will store timerTicks within distance[256] array and use 
    stored timerTicks to calculate their average. Every call to 
    calculateDistance will update distance[] 16 times and calculate distance 
    given the updated average value, clock frequency, and speed of sound
